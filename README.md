# Dropbox_website
Here is a brief overview of a sample website I created using bootstrap.

As I got to know about all the interesting facts about bootstrap I really wanted to give it a try.. 
Hence, I tried recreating the Dropbox's website.

Learning bootstrap is a journey, there are a lot of things one can explore using bootstrap, for this one
I started off with selecting a proper navigation. After going through bootstraps website thoroughly I 
selected a color that would match the website.

After which I started going through the body, adding up all the images, looking through the keywords throughout

Throughout my experience I got to learn about a lot of new things: carousel, spacing, cards.

For some parts I had to work with a carousel, which was also really fun tp work with.
In a carousel you have to add in some images which can then be used to slideshow or manually switch
from f=one image to another.

Lastly, I went on with adding the footer, I added 2*5=10 columns so that I could fit in all of the stuff I have in 
the footer part.
